C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the 
Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at 
number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern 
software programmers.

<b>Why to Learn C Programming?</b>
C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are 
working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:

Easy to learn
Structured language
It produces efficient programs
It can handle low-level activities
It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms

<b>Facts about C</b>
C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.

<b>Applications of C Programming</b>
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system 
development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use 
of C are -

Operating Systems
Language Compilers
Assemblers
Text Editors
Print Spoolers
Network Drivers
Modern Programs
Databases
Language Interpreters
Utilities

<b>Audience</b>
This tutorial is designed for software programmers with a need to understand the C programming language starting from scratch. This 
C tutorial will give you enough understanding on C programming language from where you can take yourself to higher level of expertise.

<b>Prerequisites</b>
Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding 
of any of the programming languages will help you in understanding the C programming concepts and move fast on the learning track.
