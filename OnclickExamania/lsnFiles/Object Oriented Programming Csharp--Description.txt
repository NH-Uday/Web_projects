C# 
(pronounced "C-sharp") is an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft 
that aims to combine the computing power of C++ with the programming ease of Visual Basic. C# is based on C++ and contains features similar to those of Java.

C# is designed to work with Microsoft's .Net platform. Microsoft's aim is to facilitate the exchange of information and services over the Web, and to enable 
developers to build highly portable applications. 
C# simplifies programming through its use of Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) which allow access to a programming 
object or method without requiring the programmer to write additional code for each step. 

Because programmers can build on existing code, rather than repeatedly duplicating it, C# is expected to make it faster and less expensive to get new products 
and services to market.  Microsoft is collaborating with ECMA, the international standards body, to create a standard for C#. International Standards 
Organization (ISO) recognition for C# would encourage other companies to develop their own versions of the language. Companies that are already using C# include Apex Software, Bunka Orient, Component Source, devSoft, FarPoint Technologies, LEAD Technologies, ProtoView, and Seagate Software.
